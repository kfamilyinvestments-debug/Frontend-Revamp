1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Build a modern, intuitive, frontend-only web application for Australian consumers comparing the true lifetime cost of owning a car under three scenarios:

Buying outright (cash)

Traditional car finance

Novated leasing

The core purpose is to calculate and clearly compare:

The total cost of ownership (TCO) over a selected ownership period

And, critically, the actual reduction to take-home pay (especially for novated leasing)

This tool should remove confusion, feel trustworthy, and make users understand what the car really costs them per pay cycle.

2. CORE USER INPUTS (LEFT PANEL)
A. VEHICLE DETAILS

Vehicle selector (dropdown)

Include sample vehicles:

Petrol / Diesel

Hybrid

EV

Each vehicle includes:

Fuel type

Average fuel or electricity consumption

Average servicing costs

Drive-away price

Editable numeric input

Prefilled based on vehicle selection

B. USAGE ASSUMPTIONS

Ownership period

Slider: 1–5 years

Kilometres driven per year

Slider + manual input

Default: 15,000 km

C. RUNNING COST ASSUMPTIONS (EDITABLE DEFAULTS)

Each running cost should have:

A greyed-out “average” default

Slider control

Manual override input

Include:

Fuel / Electricity

ICE: fuel price × consumption × km

EV: electricity price × kWh/100km × km

Insurance

Estimated using vehicle price and state (approximate)

Servicing

Average annual servicing by vehicle type

Tyres

Based on average tyre life (e.g. 40,000–50,000 km)

Registration + CTP

Simple annual estimate (state-based but approximate)

3. COMPARISON METHODS (TOGGLEABLE)

Allow users to compare:

Outright Purchase

Finance

Novated Lease

Users can toggle any combination (1, 2, or all 3).
All calculations and charts update dynamically.

4. OUTRIGHT PURCHASE LOGIC

Drive-away price paid upfront

Include:

Running costs over ownership period

Estimated depreciation (simple annual %)

Deduct estimated resale value at end

Outputs:

Total cost of ownership

Cost per year

Cost per pay cycle (derived later)

5. TRADITIONAL FINANCE LOGIC
Inputs:

Interest rate (slider, default ~8.5%)

Loan term = ownership period

Optional deposit

Calculations:

Monthly repayments

Total interest paid

Principal + interest + running costs

Less estimated resale value

Outputs:

Total lifetime cost

Interest clearly highlighted

6. NOVATED LEASE LOGIC (CORE ENGINE)
Defaults:

Interest rate: 9.0–9.5%

Lease term = ownership period

ATO minimum residual (balloon) values must be used

Balloon payment excluded from payroll but displayed clearly

A. FBT & TAX RULES
EVs:

FBT-exempt

Lease payments + running costs fully pre-tax

Highlight tax savings clearly

ICE / Hybrid:

Default to Statutory Method

Toggle:

“Vehicle used for work/business more than 50%”

Switch to Operating Cost Method

Reduce FBT impact accordingly

7. SALARY & PAY PROFILE (GLOBAL INPUT SECTION)

Add a “Your Salary & Pay Cycle” section used to calculate novated lease impact and normalise comparisons.

Inputs:

Annual gross salary

Default placeholder: $100,000

Pay frequency

Weekly

Fortnightly

Monthly

Optional state (simplified)

Tax Logic:

Use simplified Australian marginal tax brackets

Include Medicare levy (simplified)

Calculate:

Gross income

Income tax

Net take-home pay (baseline, no car)

8. NOVATED LEASE – TAKE-HOME PAY REDUCTION ENGINE

This is a key feature.

Logic:

Split novated costs into:

Pre-tax deductions

Lease payments

Running costs

Fully pre-tax for EVs

Post-tax deductions

FBT-applicable amounts (ICE/Hybrid)

Calculate:

Income tax saved

Net after-tax cost

Reduction to take-home pay

Outputs (VERY IMPORTANT):

Display clearly:

Reduction to take-home pay:

Weekly / Fortnightly / Monthly (based on user selection)

Annual impact

Total impact over lease term

Example:

“Your take-home pay reduces by $284 per fortnight”

Also show:

Take-home pay before car

Take-home pay after novated lease

Tax savings highlighted

9. NORMALISING COMPARISONS ACROSS ALL METHODS

To enable true apples-to-apples comparison:

Finance & Outright:

Convert total costs into:

After-tax equivalent

Cost per pay cycle

Show:

“To afford this cost, you’d need to earn $X pre-tax”

10. GLOBAL DISPLAY TOGGLE

Add a global toggle:

“Show costs as:”

Weekly

Fortnightly

Monthly

Annually

This toggle updates:

All comparison cards

Charts

Cost breakdowns

11. COMPARISON OUTPUT (BOTTOM SECTION)
Visuals:

Side-by-side comparison cards

Bar chart comparing total lifetime cost

Each card shows:

Total lifetime cost

Cost per pay cycle

Cost per year

Key insight (e.g. tax saved, interest paid)

Highlight:

Lowest total cost

Lowest take-home pay impact
(these may be different — make that clear)

12. UX / UI PRINCIPLES

Clean, modern Australian finance aesthetic

Intuitive sliders

Tooltips explaining:

FBT

Pre-tax vs post-tax

Balloon payments

Mobile responsive

No sales language

No login required

13. TECH REQUIREMENTS

Frontend-only (HTML/CSS/JS or React)

All calculations run instantly in-browser

Modular, commented code

Easy to update assumptions later

14. DISCLAIMER

Include subtle disclaimer:

“This calculator provides estimates only and does not constitute financial or tax advice.”

15. END GOAL

The finished product should make users think:

“That’s the first time I actually understand what this car costs me each payday.”

Build this now as a fully functional, polished web application.
